        <p> <!-- September 4 2023-->
            Sept 4 2023<br>
            Starting to realize that not all users that we onboard may be of value / quality to the site. 
            Our matching system relies on the assumption that both people are genuinely looking for a ride-share
            and thus if they are matched, will take that rideshare. However, if people sign up for the wrong reasons
            or are lured by the wrong incentives, such as those that can come from our marketing efforts that give
            a new user some value outside of the app (like a donut or a giftcard), they might have a higher chance to cancel
            their trip and pain another one of our users. <br>
            This ties in to the difficulty I'm facing related to growth / marketing efforts on campus. 
            Other companies that I've seen on campus (Sidechat, Pollinate) are able to give out incentives
            of any kind becuase one more person on the site can't really negatively effect others' experience: 
            one user being inactive or not engaging with posts doesn't harm anyone else. For us though, 
            if someone has signed up and been paired, then are suddenly inactive or cancel their trip, they
            are leaving someone else stranded. <br>
            Let's think of some reasons why someone would cancel to help us understand what incentives might
            attract the right customers:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>[1] person never needed the rideshare in the first place (they live in chicago, not travelling); or didn't intend on sharing one</li>
                <li>[2] the person found a friend to share the ride with, and thus cancelled on the stranger</li>
                <li>[3] the person's flight or schedule got changed</li>
                <li>[4] the person was running late and didn't want to hold up the other person</li>
            </ul>
            [1] is probably the type of person who would respond to incentives that have nothing to do with
            the trip and should be avoided at all costs - their participation in the network only hurts it. 
            Having the possibility of this user entering the network kind of rules out all outside incentives that don't have anything to do with our product.<br>
            [2] is just back luck for us. this is what most people try to do in the first place - what we can try to prevent is people from cancelling
            even when they found a friend. <i>Brings up the idea of rewarding based on ride completion and not sign up; we care about a lot of people signing 
            up to have more chances to match but we don't really want to reward sign up, what we want to reward is completing the ride. Maybe that's where we 
            introduce incentive: complete the ride, get something. Then it doesn't really matter if that something is related to our company or not
            becuase they've already used our service.</i><br>
            [3] again just bad luck, nothing we can really do about this but hope that they sign up with us for our next ride. 
            [4] incentive people to complete the trip, not just sign up for a trip - if people can't miss the trip because they'll miss out on the incentive
            maybe they pack and plan early.<br><br>

            Therefore, sign up isn't what we reward people for but rather completing the ride.<br><br>

            Now I want to think about how much we want to spend on people who have completed the ride. Rewarding each user individually might be really expensive, maybe
            a joint gift to both people would be better? I'm thinking about potentially paying back some of the ride, like $5 per ride, so $2.5 per person. It would make the trip
            expensive for us, especially if we have upwards of 100 trips ($500). And I also don't know how giving the reward amount a dollar amount
            influences their value trade off of things like being late and cancelling, or cancelling to ride with a friend. <br>
            Ideally people see how much we're saving them and choose to stick with us, but maybe they need some initial help doing so. <br>
            I don't really want to take the risk of incentivizing pre-ride in order to avoid bad actors but I'm not sure what to incentive people with.
